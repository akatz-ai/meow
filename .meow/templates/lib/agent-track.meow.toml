# ============================================================================
# MEOW Library: Agent Track Lifecycle
# ============================================================================
#
# Complete agent lifecycle: spawn → work → review → verify-clean → kill
#
# This is the battle-tested pattern extracted from dual/quad agent workflows.
# Each agent works in isolation, self-reviews, ensures clean git state, then exits.
#
# Variables:
#   agent_name   (required) - Unique agent identifier
#   track_name   (required) - Track name for logging/identification
#   workdir      (required) - Working directory (typically a worktree path)
#   task_prompt  (required) - The main task prompt for the agent
#   spec_file    (default: "docs/MVP-SPEC-v2.md") - Spec file to read first
#
# Usage:
#   [[main.steps]]
#   id = "worker-1"
#   executor = "expand"
#   template = "lib/agent-track"
#   variables = {
#     agent_name = "agent-1",
#     track_name = "feature-x",
#     workdir = "{{setup-worktree.create.outputs.path}}",
#     task_prompt = "Implement feature X..."
#   }

# {{track_name}} Agent Task

## FIRST: Read the Specification
Before doing ANY work, read the complete specification:

@{{spec_file}}

This is REQUIRED. The spec defines all types, patterns, and constraints you must follow.

## Your Assignment

{{task_prompt}}

## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- **ONLY** implement the work described above
- Do NOT work on unrelated beads or issues you might see
- Do NOT modify files outside your assignment scope
- If you discover related work needed, note it but do NOT implement it

## Workflow
1. If beads are referenced, run `bd show <bead-id>` for full requirements
2. Write tests first (TDD approach) when implementing code
3. Implement the minimum code to pass tests
4. Commit after each logical unit with a clear message
5. If beads are referenced, close them as you complete: `bd close <bead-id>`

## When Done
After ALL your assigned work is complete, run:

```
meow done
```

# Step 3: Self-Review
# ============================================================================

[[main.steps]]
id = "review"
executor = "agent"
agent = "{{agent_name}}"
needs = ["work"]
prompt = """
# Self-Review: {{track_name}} Track

Take a step back and carefully reread your most recent code changes with fresh eyes.

## Review Checklist
1. **Read each file you modified** - look at the actual code, not your memory of it
2. **Check for obvious bugs** - nil pointer dereferences, off-by-one errors, typos
3. **Check for logical errors** - does the code actually do what it claims?
4. **Verify test coverage** - do tests actually test the important behavior?
5. **Check imports** - any unused imports? Missing imports that will cause build failures?
6. **Run tests** - `go test ./...` or equivalent for the project

## Actions
- Fix anything you spot without waiting for direction
- If you make fixes, commit them with message: "fix: self-review corrections for {{track_name}}"

## When Done
```
meow done
```

# Final Commit Check: {{track_name}} Track

Ensure ALL your changes are committed.

## Steps
1. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
2. If uncommitted: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: final changes for {{track_name}}"`
3. Run `git status` again to verify clean
4. Run `git log --oneline -5` to show recent commits

When clean, run: `meow done`

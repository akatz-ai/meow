# MEOW Library: Sprint Common Templates
# ============================================================================
#
# Shared templates for sprint workflows (parallel and sequential).
# These templates handle worktree setup, integration, and agent track wrapping.
#
# Available templates:
#   - setup: Creates worktrees and enriches task list
#   - integration: Merges all task branches
#   - agent-track-wrapper: Wraps lib/agent-track with spec handling
#
# ============================================================================

# SETUP (Public)

# Integration Agent: Merge All Sprint Tracks into {{target_branch}}

Your job is to merge all feature branches into {{target_branch}}.
When parallel agents work on the same files, conflicts are expected. Resolve them.

## Step 1: Get Branch Names from Enriched Tasks

The authoritative source for branch names is `.enriched-tasks.json`:
```bash
# Read branch info from the enriched tasks file (created fresh each sprint)
cat .meow/worktrees/.enriched-tasks.json | jq -r '.[] | "\\(.name): \\(.branch)"'
```

This file contains the exact branch names created for this sprint run.
Do NOT rely on `.meow-branch` files in worktree directories - they may be stale.

## Step 2: Merge Each Branch

For each track in the enriched tasks:
```bash
# Example: merge agent1-track branch
BRANCH=$(jq -r '.[] | select(.name == "agent1") | .branch' .meow/worktrees/.enriched-tasks.json)
git merge "$BRANCH" --no-edit -m "Merge: agent1-track"
```

Or loop through all:
```bash
for row in $(jq -c '.[]' .meow/worktrees/.enriched-tasks.json); do
  NAME=$(echo "$row" | jq -r '.name')
  BRANCH=$(echo "$row" | jq -r '.branch')
  echo "Merging $NAME ($BRANCH)..."
  git merge "$BRANCH" --no-edit -m "Merge: $NAME-track"
done
```

If the merge succeeds, continue to the next branch.

## If Conflicts Occur

When you see "CONFLICT" in the output:
1. Run `git status` to see conflicted files
2. For `.meow-branch` conflicts: just pick either version
   ```bash
   git checkout --theirs .meow-branch
   git add .meow-branch
   ```
3. For test file conflicts (e.g., `*_test.go`):
   - Both branches typically added content at the end
   - Keep BOTH sets of content (combine them)
   - Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
4. For other conflicts:
   - Read both versions carefully
   - Combine logically (don't lose either side's changes)
5. Stage resolved files: `git add <file>`
6. Complete the merge: `git commit -m "Merge: <track-name> (conflicts resolved)"`
7. Continue with the next branch

## Step 3: Verify Build and Tests

1. Run `go build ./...` to verify build passes
2. Run `go test -short ./...` to verify tests pass
3. If tests fail, fix the issues and commit

## Step 4: Push to {{target_branch}}

After all merges pass tests, push directly to {{target_branch}}:
```bash
git push origin HEAD:{{target_branch}}
```

When pushed successfully: `meow done`

You've been assigned {{task.task_system}}: {{task.task_ids}}

## Process

1. For each ID above, query the task system to see full requirements
   - For beads: `bd show <bead-id>`
   - For other systems: see CLAUDE.md for instructions

2. Implement each task following TDD approach:
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement minimum code to pass
   - Refactor if needed

3. Commit after each logical unit with clear messages

4. Close/complete tasks as you finish them:
   - For beads: `bd close <bead-id>`
   - For other systems: see CLAUDE.md

5. When ALL tasks are complete, run: `meow done`

## Important

- ONLY work on the tasks assigned above
- Do NOT work on unrelated tasks you might discover
- If you find related work needed, note it but do NOT implement it
